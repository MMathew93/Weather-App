# weather-app
A simple weather application apart of the Odin Project curriculum. 
The project pulls data from the free OpenWeatherMap api and displays the data.
This project will allow the user to switch between faranheit and celsius. You are able to search specific cities as well.
Finally a ranom button was added to randomly generate a zip code and pull the weather from that location.
If denied access the project will not pull your weather data specifically.
An additional api was used to get a more accurate location for weather when using the HTML
geolocation.
