# weather-app
Had to take down the inital repo due to me pushing it with my api information exposed
If you need to use this you will need a free api from:
OpenWeatherMap
LocationIQ
Then just insert the LocationIQ api into the geolocation fetch
and the OpenWeatherMap api into the weather fetch
These are located in the Content.Vue file.
